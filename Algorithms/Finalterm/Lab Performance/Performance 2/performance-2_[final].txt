DEADLINE: 11:00 AM Today

1. Problem Statement:
--------------------
You are given the following array stating the dimensions of matrices for a Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM):
d = {13,42,45,21,24,43,15,2}

Use this information to build an MCM and find out the minimum number of multiplications needed to perform the MCM. 

You are not required to find out the parenthisization of the matrices and their orders in which the MCM will yeild to minimum number of multiplications.

Example output format (for an imaginary data):
The minimum number of multiplications needed for the MCM = 15125

Submission instructions:
------------------------

Write a C/ C++/ Java program to solve the above-mentioned problems.

Your solution should be in one file. Rename the file with your AIUB student ID. For example, if your student ID is 11-18421-1, for a c++ file, the name of the file with extension should be 11-18421-1.cpp. Upload that file in the following path in the student portal:

Courses & Results => Algorithms => Final Term => Lab Perofrmance => Performance-2 => Upload

This text file is also uploaded in MS TEAMS under the 'Files' tab as well as in the above path of your student portal. A small template c++ code is also provided for your convenience. Use of this template code is optional.

If you have any question, text me or the TAs directly in TEAMS. You are not allowed to use mic during a lab performance.
