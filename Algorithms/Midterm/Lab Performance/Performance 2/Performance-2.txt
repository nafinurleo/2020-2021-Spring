1. Problem Statement:
--------------------
Take a string as input and using the Quick Sort algorithm sort the string in a descending order (character-wise).

The input string must contain only capital letter English alphabets as its characters. Any other input should be considered invalid.

2. Problem Statement:
--------------------
Take a numeric array as input and using the Counting Sort algorithm sort the string in a descending order.

The input array must contain only single digit numerals as each element. Any other input should be considered invalid.

Submission instructions:
------------------------

Write a C/ C++/ Java program to solve the above-mentioned problems.

Your solution should be in one file. Make use of functions for different sorting techniques to seperate implementations modularly. Rename the file with your AIUB student ID. For example, if your student ID is 11-18421-1, for a c++ file, the name of the file with extension should be 11-18421-1.cpp. Upload that file in the following path in the student portal:

Courses & Results => Algorithms => Lab Perofrmance => Performance-2 => Upload

This text file is also uploaded in MS TEAMS under the 'Files' tab as well as in the above path of your student portal. Download it and start working.

If you have any question, text me directly in TEAMS. You are not allowed to use mic during a lab performance
